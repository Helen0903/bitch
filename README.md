# bitch
Minimal esolang based around bitwise operations. Spritual predecessor to BITCHWISE.

Simply compile the java file with:<br>
`javac bitch.java`<br>
And run with:<br>
`java bitch BITCHFILE` for integer I/O<br>
`java bitch -c BITCHFILE` for character I/O

A [.jar of bitch v2.0 is available here](https://github.com/Helen0903/bitch/releases/download/v2.0/bitch.jar).<br>
The .jar is runnable in essentially the same way:<br>
`java -jar bitch.jar BITCHFILE` for integer I/O<br>
`java -jar bitch.jar -c BITCHFILE` for character I/O

An esolangs article explaining what bitch is and how it works can be found at: https://esolangs.org/wiki/Bitch.<br>
This article contains an interactive interpreter rather than the one found here.<br>
Furthermore, neither the interpreter nor the article contain the -c flag or any information regarding it.<br>
The usage of the snippet in the article is simply:<br>
`java bitch.java`<br>
And run with:<br>
`java bitch`<br>
You then input your code, which will then be interpreted as soon as you hit enter.
